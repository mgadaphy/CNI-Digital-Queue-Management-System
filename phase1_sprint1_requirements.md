# Phase 1 - Sprint 1: Requirements Analysis & System Design
## CNI Digital Queue Management System - Detailed Requirements Specification

### Research-Based Context Analysis

Based on current research and industry practices, our system addresses critical challenges:

#### Current CNI Process Context (February 2025)
- Cameroon launched online pre-enrollment via www.idcam.cm on February 17, 2025, with biometric capture starting February 24
- The new system promises CNI issuance within 48 hours after physical enrollment
- Process involves two phases: online enrollment followed by physical biometric capture

#### Industry Best Practices Integration
- Modern government queue management systems focus on managing visitor flow with multiple queues and clear communication through digital signage
- Digital systems dramatically improve citizen flow through self-service sign-in processes
- AI and real-time analytics are transforming public service queue optimization
